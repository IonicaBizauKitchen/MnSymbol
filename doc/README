MnSymbols is a symbol font designed to be used in conjunction with Adobe
Minion. The current release is a beta version. In particular, the font
metrics may change in the future.

All files in this archive are in the public domain.

To install the fonts, copy all files with the suffix .mf into the
directory

   .../texmf/fonts/source/public/MnSymbol/

copy the file MnSymbol.sty to

   .../texmf/tex/latex/MnSymbol/MnSymbol.sty

and the documentation (tables.tex, tables.ps, README) should go into
the directory

   .../texmf/doc/latex/MnSymbol/

After you have copied the files you need to regenerate the file
database.

To use the font, include the line

  \usepackage{MnSymbol}

in the preamble of your document.
