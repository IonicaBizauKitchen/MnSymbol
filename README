MnSymbol Modifications
======================

This repository is based on MnSymbol by Achim Blumensath, a
mathematical symbol font for Adobe Minion Pro, and includes minor font
modifications.

If you have already installed the original MnSymbol, just replace or
add the files:
    o    pfb/*    in .../texmf/fonts/type1/public/MnSymbol/
    o    source/* in .../texmf/fonts/source/public/mnsymbol/
If you have not installed MnSymbol yet, follow doc/README.

The Makefile and scripts are partly adapted from the FdSymbol project
by Michael Ummels.  DO NOT USE THE MAKEFILE unless you know what you
are doing.
