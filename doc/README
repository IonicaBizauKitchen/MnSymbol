MnSymbol is a symbol font designed to be used in conjunction with Adobe
MinionPro.

All files in this archive are in the public domain.

NOTE: This version includes one bugfix that causes incompatibilities with
previous versions. The symbols

  \...harpoonup and \...harpoondown

are now called

  \...harpoonccw and \...harpooncw

(This was needed for compatibility with amsfonts.sty.)


To install the fonts:

(1) Run

  $ latex MnSymbol.ins

(2) Copy all files with the suffix .mf into the directory

   .../texmf/fonts/source/public/MnSymbol/

(3) Copy the file MnSymbol.sty to

   .../texmf/tex/latex/MnSymbol/MnSymbol.sty

(4) Copy the documentation (MnSymbol.ps, MnSymbol.pdf, README) into the directory

   .../texmf/doc/latex/MnSymbol/

(5) If you also want to install the PostScript fonts (these are traced fonts
of low quality) copy

  o ps-fonts/MnSymbol.map into .../texmf/fonts/map/dvips/MnSymbol
  o ps-fonts/*.enc        into .../texmf/fonts/enc/dvips/MnSymbol
  o ps-fonts/*.pfb        into .../texmf/fonts/type1/public/MnSymbol

(6) Regenerate the file database.
